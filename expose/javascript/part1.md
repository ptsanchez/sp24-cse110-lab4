Question 1: 'values added: 20' is printed by line 9.

Question 2: 'final result: 20' is printed be line 13.

Question 3: 'values added: 20' is printed by line 9. 

Question 4: The code returns an error. The variable **result** is declared with the *let* keyword which means that **result** is visible and usable only inside the code block is it defined in. Since it is defined inside of the if statement, **result** is not defined for line 13.

Quetion 5: The code return an error. Since **result** is declared with the *const* keyword, this means that after this decleration on line 5, *result* cannot be re-assigned, yet the code does so on line 7. Hence, line 9 is never printed.
Question 6: Same as question 5. he code return an error. Since **result** is declared with the *const* keyword, this means that after this decleration on line 5, *result* cannot be re-assigned, yet the code does so on line 7. Hence, line 13 is never printed.
